# Versions

This might be the final version of the game.

I couldn't find the version 3.3, maybe I deleted it.

# What is New?

This version fixed bugs with all the buttons.

I made the hitbox on the buttons more accurate.

I probably will fix the hitbox on the circles if I have time.

(which I probably never)
